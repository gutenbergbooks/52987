From the rich treasures he has left, the

<span class="small">OF THE SITUATION AND NUMBER OF
MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>1. The Mucous Membranes occupy the
interior of those cavities, which, by various
openings, communicate with the skin.
Their number, at the first view, appears
very considerable; for the organs within
which they are reflected are numerous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The stomach, bladder, urethra, uterus, ureters,
the intestines, &amp;c., borrow from these
membranes a part of their structure: nevertheless,
if it be considered, that they
are continuous throughout, that everywhere
they are observed to be extended
from one organ to others, arising, as they
did at first, from the skin, their number
will appear to be singularly limited. In
fact, in thus contemplating them, not as
insulated in each part, but as continued
over various organs, it will appear that
they are reducible to two general surfaces.</p>

<p>2. The first of these two surfaces, entering
by the mouth, nose, and anterior
surface of the eye, (1) lines the first and
second of these cavities: from the first it
extends into the excretory ducts of the
parotid and submaxillary glands; from the
other it is continued into all the sinuses,
it forms the tunica conjunctiva, descends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
by the puncta lacrymalia through the canal
and lacrymal sac to the nose. (2) It
descends into the pharynx, and there
furnishes the inner surface of the Eustachian
tube, and thence it penetrates and
lines the internal ear. (3) It sinks into
the trachea, and spreads itself over all
the air passages. (4) It enters the œsophagus
and stomach. (5) It extends into
the duodenum, where it furnishes two
branches, one destined to the ductus
communis choledochus, to the numerous
rami of the hepatic duct, to the cystic
duct and gall bladder; the other to the
pancreatic duct and its various ramifications.
(6) It is continued into the small
and large intestines, and finally terminates
at the anus, where it is identified with the
skin.</p>

<p>3. The second general mucous membrane
enters, in men, by the urethra, and
thence spreads from one part through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
bladder, ureters, pelves, calices, papillæ,
and uriniferous tubes; from the other it
sinks into the excretory ducts of the
prostate gland, into the ejaculatory ducts,
the vesicula seminales, the vassa defferentia,
and the infinitely convoluted branches
from which they arise. In women, this
membrane enters by the vulva, and from
one part penetrates the urethra, and is
distributed, as in men, through the urinary
organs; from the other part it extends
into the vagina, which it lines, as it also
does the uterus and the fallopian tubes,
and through the apertures at the extremities
of these ducts it comes in contact
with the peritoneum. This is the only
example in the economy, of a communication
between the mucous and serous surfaces.</p>

<p>4. This manner of describing the track
of the mucous surfaces by saying that
they extend, sink, penetrate, &amp;c., from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
one cavity to another, is certainly not
conformable to the march of nature, which
forms in each organ the membranes that
belong to it, and does not thus extend
them from one to the other; but our
manner of conceiving is best accommodated
by this language, of which the least
reflection will rectify the sense.</p>

<p>5. In thus bringing all the mucous surfaces
to two general membranes, I am
supported, not only by anatomical inspection,
but pathological observation also
furnishes me with lines of demarcation
between the two, and with points of contact
between the different portions of the
membranes of which each is the assemblage.
In the various sketches of epidemic
catarrhs made by authors, we frequently
see one of these membranes has
been affected throughout its extent, whilst
the other, on the contrary, has remained
untouched. It is not uncommon to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a general affection of the first, <em>viz.</em> that
which extends from the mouth, nose, and
anterior surface of the eye, into the alimentary
canal and bronchi. The last
epidemic observed at Paris, with which
M. Pinel was himself affected, bore this
character: that of 1761, described by
Rayons, presented the same feature: that
of 1732, described in the Memoirs of the
Edinburgh Society, was remarkable for a
like phenomenon. Now we do not see at
the same time a corresponding affection in
the mucous membrane which spreads over
the organs of urine and of generation.
Here is, therefore, (1) an analogy between
the different portions of the first, by the
uniformity of the affection; (2) a line of
demarcation between them, by the healthy
state of the one and the disease of the
other.</p>

<p>6. We observe also, that irritation on
any one point of these membranes fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>quently
produces a pain in another point
of the same membrane, which is not irritated;
thus a stone in the bladder causes
a pain at the end of the glans, worms in
the intestines produce an itching at the
nose, &amp;c. &amp;c. Now in these phenomena,
which are purely sympathetic, it is extremely
rare that the partial irritation of
one of these two membranes produces
a painful affection in a part of the other.</p>

<p>7. We ought, therefore, from inspection
and observation, to consider the mucous
surface in general as formed by two grand
membranes, spread over several organs,
and having no communication with each
other but by the skin, which is intermediate,
and which, being continuous with
both, thus concurs with them to form a
general membrane, entire throughout, enveloping
the exterior of the animal, and
extending to the interior over most of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
essential parts. It should seem, that there
exists important relations between the internal
and external portions of this unique
membrane, and this we shall soon be
shown by ulterior researches.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">OF THE EXTERIOR ORGANIZATION OF
MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>8. Every mucous membrane presents
two surfaces; the one adhering to the
adjacent organs; the other free, beset
with villosities, and always moist with a
mucous fluid: each of them deserves a
particular attention.</p>

<p>9. The adherent surface is attached to
muscles almost throughout its extent.
The mouth, the pharynx, the whole of
the alimentary canal, the bladder, the vagina,
the uterus, and part of the urethra,
&amp;c. present a muscular bed, embracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the exterior of their mucous coat. In
animals that have the panniculus carnosus,
this disposition perfectly coincides
with that of the skin, which, as we shall
see, is in other respects analogous in
structure to mucous membranes. In man
the cutaneous organ presents here and
there traces of this exterior muscle, as we
observe in the platysma myoides, the palmaris
brevis, the occipito frontalis, in
most of the muscles of the face, &amp;c. This
disposition of mucous membranes places
them under the influence of those habitual
changes of contraction and dilatation,
which are favourable to their secretion,
and various other functions.</p>

<p>10. This muscular bed is not immediately
inserted into the exterior surface
of the mucous membranes, but rather,
according to Albinus, into a dense layer
of cellular tissue, which all the ancient
authors have denominated, in the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
intestines, and bladder, the nervous coat;
but when well examined it presents no
character analogous to that which the
name indicates. The experiment of inflation,
by which it is brought into its
primitive state, is not so easy as Albinus
and others have pretended; which led me
to think that its nature might not be cellular,
but that it was probably of a fibrous
texture, formed by a web of extremely
delicate and scarcely visible tendons, offering
points of origin and insertion to all
the fleshy fibres of the muscular bed,
which, as we know, never describe entire
circles, but rather different segments of
that curve. I confess that this conjecture,
though very likely, is not founded upon
any decisive and rigorous experiment.</p>

<p>11. Whatever may be the nature of
this intermediate membrane to the mucous
and muscular coats, it evidently has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a dense, close texture, which gives it a
resistance very analogous to one of the
fibrous membranes. It is from this that
the organ receives its form; it is this
which maintains and controls its shape,
as may be proved by the following experiment.
Take a portion of intestine: remove
in any part of the bowel a part of
this membrane, with the serous and muscular
membranes: having applied a ligature
to the inferior end, inflate it, the air
will produce in the denuded part an hernia
of the mucous coat. Take another
portion of intestine, turn it, dissect off a
small part of the mucous membrane and
of this coat: inflation will produce upon
the serous and muscular coats the same
phenomenon as in the preceding case it
did in the mucous membrane. It is therefore
to this intermediate tunic that the
mucous membrane owes its power of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>sistance
to substances which distend it.
This applies equally to the stomach, bladder,
œsophagus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>12. The free surface of mucous membranes,
or that which is continually moistened
by the fluid from which they borrow
their name, presents two kinds of wrinkles
or folds, the one inherent in their structure
and which is constantly present,
whatever may be their state of contraction
or dilatation, such as the pylorus, the
valvula conniventes, the valve of the
colon, &amp;c. These folds are formed, not
merely by the mucous membranes, but
also by the intermediate membrane mentioned
above, and which in these parts
takes a remarkable density and thickness.</p>

<p>13. The other folds may be called accidental,
and are only observed during
the contraction of the organ; such are
those of the inner surface of the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and of the large intestines, &amp;c. In most
of the human subjects brought to our
amphitheatres, these folds in the stomach,
of which so much has been said,
are not perceptible, because generally the
subject has died of a disease which has
impaired the vital powers, without preventing
all the action of this viscus; so
that, although it is frequently found empty,
its fibres are not in the least contracted.</p>

<p>14. In experiments on living animals,
on the contrary, these folds are very apparent;
and observe how they may be demonstrated.
Let a dog eat or drink copiously;
open it immediately, and make
an incision into the stomach the whole
length of its greater curvature, no fold
will then appear, but it soon contracts, its
edges are drawn in, and the whole of the
mucous surface is covered with numerous
prominent plicæ in the form of circumvolutions.
The same result may be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the stomach of a recently killed animal
by distending it with air, and then opening
it; or, what is still better, by laying it
open whilst empty, and stretching it, the
folds will disappear, and when we cease
to make the extension they immediately
form again and are very apparent.</p>

<p>15. I would observe on the subject of
inflating the stomach, that by distending
it with oxygen gas the application of this
fluid does not produce more prominent
folds, and therefore no stronger contraction,
than when carbonic acid gas is used
for the same purpose. This experiment
presents a result very similar to what I
have observed when I have rendered animals
emphysematous by different æriform
fluids. Frogs and Guinea pigs (these are
the two kinds I have chosen, the one being
an animal of red and cold, and the
other of red and warm blood) presented
very little difference in their irritability, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their Galvanic susceptibility, whether inflated
with oxygen gas or with carbonic
acid gas. They live very well with this
artificial emphysema, which gradually disappears.
Inflation with nitrous gas is always
mortal, and its contact appears to
strike the muscles with atony. The stomach
distended with it very soon loses
its power of contracting, and its folds disappear.
Here, as in all the experiments
which have the vital powers for their object,
we frequently obtain very variable
results.</p>

<p>16. It follows, from what we have said
respecting the folds of mucous membranes,
that in the contraction of the hollow organs,
which are lined by them, they suffer
but a very trifling diminution of surface,
they scarcely contract at all, but fold
themselves within; so that in dissecting
them upon their contracted organ, we
have an extent of surface nearly equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that which they present during its dilatation.
This assertion, which is true concerning
the stomach, the œsophagus, and
the intestines, is, perhaps, not quite so as
respects the bladder, whose contraction
does not show within such prominent
folds, but they are sufficiently marked to
bring the mucous membrane of this organ
under the general law. It is, also, nearly
the same with the gall bladder; yet we
find here another cause; observed alternately,
in a state of hunger and during digestion,
it will be found to contain double
the quantity of bile in the former case
that it does in the latter, as I have had
the opportunity of seeing in numerous instances,
in experiments made with this
object in view, or with other intentions.
Now, when it has evacuated part of its
contents it does not contract upon the remainder
of the bile, with the energy of
the stomach when it contains but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
food, nor with the power of the bladder
when it contains but a small quantity of
urine, but is then flaccid, so that its distention
or nondistention has but very
trifling influence upon the folds of its mucous
membranes.</p>

<p>17. Moreover, in saying that the mucous
membranes present with trifling variation
the same extent of surface in the dilatations
as during the contraction of their
respective organs, I intend to speak of
the ordinary state of the functions only,
and not of those enormous dilatations
which are frequently seen in the stomach
and bladder, more rarely in the intestines.
In such cases there is doubtless a real
extension, which in the membrane coincides
with that of the organ.</p>

<p>18. One remarkable observation that the
free surface of mucous membranes affords
us, and which I have already pointed out,
is, that this face is everywhere in contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with bodies of a different nature to that of
the animal: these bodies are either introduced
from without for its nourishment, and
are not yet assimilated to its substance, as
we see in the alimentary canal and in the
trachea, or they are produced within, as
we observe in the excretory ducts of the
glands, which all open into cavities lined
by mucous membranes, and discharge
those particles, which, after having for
some time formed a part of the composition
of the solids, become heterogeneous
to them, and are thrown off by that habitual
action of decomposition, which
takes place in living bodies. According
to this observation we must consider the
mucous membranes as defensive coats,
placed between our organs and foreign
bodies, and that they consequently serve
the same purpose internally which the
skin does externally, as respects bodies
that are in contact with it.</p>

<span class="small">OF THE INTERIOR ORGANIZATION OF
MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>19. Between the mucous and other
membranes, as respects their interior organization,
there is this essential difference,
that they are always formed by
several thin fibrous layers; these layers
or coats are, with the exception of the
rete mucosum, the same as those which
compose the skin with which these membranes
have the most exact analogy. We
are about to examine separately each
of these layers, which are the epidermis,
the corps papillaire, and the chorion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in their general attributes; we shall afterwards
consider the particular modifications
which they undergo in the different parts
of the mucous surfaces.</p>

<p>20. All authors have admitted the
epidermis of mucous membranes: it appears,
even, that the greatest part of
them have believed that it is merely
that portion of the skin which descends
into the cavities to line them; Haller
in particular is of this opinion; but the
least inspection is sufficient to show, that
here, as in the skin, it forms but a layer
superficial to the corps papillaire and
chorion; boiling water, which detaches
it from the surface of the palate, the
tongue, and even from the pharynx,
leaves the two other coats denuded and
apparent.</p>

<p>21. This epidermis is very distinct upon
the glans, at the anus, at the orifice
of the urethra, at the entrances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nasal fossæ, and of the mouth, and in
general wherever the mucous membranes
arise from the skin. It is demonstrated
in these different places by the frequent
excoriations which occur on them; it
may be raised from the lips by a very
fine lancet by the action of boiling water,
a hot iron, or even by epispastics, as
the method of the ancients proves, who
employed them to produce a fresh raw
surface for the cure of the hare lip.</p>

<p>22. But in proportion as we go into
the depth of the mucous membranes, the
existence of this coat becomes more difficult
to be demonstrated; it cannot be
raised by the finest instrument, nor detached
by boiling water, at least in
the gall bladder, in the stomach, and
intestines. I have made these experiments
in fresh slain animals, and also
in those where the natural heat had
quite left them. But what our experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ments
cannot effect, inflammations will
often produce. All the authors, who have
written on the affections of the organs
which are lined by these membranes,
mention instances in which flakes, more
or less considerable, have been voided
by the urethra, anus, mouth, nostrils, &amp;c.
Haller has collected a great number of
similar observations. Without doubt the
separation of the epidermis in these cases
is produced nearly in the same way as
we observe it in cutaneous inflammations.
In many subjects that have died with
symptoms of inflammation of the mucous
membranes, and which I have already
had the opportunity of dissecting, or of
seeing dissected, I have not yet been able
to observe this separation going on; that
is to say, the epidermis separated at
one point, and still remaining adherent
at others, as in erysipelas. I have tried
in vain to produce this effect by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
application of an epispastic to the inner
surface of the intestines of a dog.</p>

<p>23. This epidermis is subject, like that
of the skin, to become callous by pressure.
Choppart cites a case of a shepherd,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dont le canal de l'urètre présentoit
cette disposition, à la suite de l'introduction
fréquemment répétée d'une petite
baguette pour se procurer des jouissances
voluptueuses</span>." We know the density
that this envelope takes in the stomachs
of the gallinacea. In certain circumstances,
where the mucous membranes
are protruded from the body, as in prolapsus
ani, inversion of the vagina, in the
artificial anus, &amp;c., sometimes the pressure
of the dress produces in this epidermis
a thickness evidently more considerable
than is natural to it.</p>

<p>24. The epidermis is attached to the
hair on the skin, although it does not
afford its immediate origin; sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
also piliform productions are observed in
the mucous membranes. The bladder,
the stomach, the intestines, and the pituitary
membrane have been in various
instances the seat of these unnatural excrescences:
Haller has cited various instances
of them.</p>

<p>25. This envelope appears to have upon
the mucous surfaces the same texture as
on the skin, excepting in the delicacy of
the laminæ from which it is produced.
It is to this delicacy, which gives more
exposure to the nerves, that we must
doubtless refer the facility with which
we excite various remarkable modifications
in the sensibility, when by the Galvanic
process we apply zinc to the mucous
surface of the conjunctiva, the pituitary
membrane, the internal membrane of the
rectum, or of the gums, &amp;c., and bring
these several metal plates into mediate or
immediate contact. The epidermis when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
removed is quickly reproduced; being
destitute of all kinds of sensibility, it in
this respect serves the same purpose as
the skin, by guarding the very sensible
corps papillaire which is subjacent to it.
To its presence over the mucous membranes
we must attribute the ability they
have of being exposed to the air, and
even to the contact of foreign bodies,
without excoriating or inflaming, as is seen
in cases of artificial anus, prolapsus ani,
&amp;c., whilst serous and fibrous membranes
never suffer such exposure with impunity.
Hence there is no danger, in this respect,
from opening the bladder: hence, on the
contrary, that precept so justly recommended,
not to open the cavity of the
peritoneum, and to make the least possible
incision into the synovial capsules. I
would observe, that the existence of the
epidermis upon mucous membranes is an
important consideration, as respects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
opinion of those who, like Séguin, believing
them to be without it, have said,
that contagion is always received by the
lungs, and not by the skin, which is, according
to them, defended by this envelope.</p>

<p>26. In the organization of the skin,
immediately under the epidermis is placed
the corpus mucosum, particularly described
by Malpighi, and generally considered
as the seat of colour in the different
varieties of the human species. It
is described as a coat, pierced with holes
by the passage of the nervous papillæ:
M. Sabattier points out the manner of
demonstrating it. Sömmering has, it is
said, seen it separated from the epidermis
and chorion on the scrotum of an Ethiopian.
I confess that I have not yet been
able to perceive it: M. Portal does not
appear to have been more fortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>27. We distinguish only a kind of gelatinous
juice intermediate to the corps
papillaire and epidermis, and most commonly
it is not even apparent; I have
never been able to observe more with
certainty. In examining the skin of a
Negro with attention, the epidermis being
detached, I have seen the external surface
of the chorion tinged with black, and that
was all. Further, whatever this corpus
mucosum may be, it certainly does not
exist in mucous membranes, since they
do not participate in the colour of the
integuments. The heat of the sun, which
darkens these in white people, does not
appear to act upon the commencement
of these membranes, which are equally
exposed with them to its influence, as
is seen in the red borders of the lips, &amp;c.
Nevertheless, I have many times remarked
on the palates of dogs, which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the subjects of my experiments, similar
spots to those which have marked their
skin.</p>

<p>28. The sensibility of the skin is principally
owing to the corps papillaire; that
of the mucous membranes, exactly analogous
to that of the skin, appears to me
to arise from the same cause. The nervous
papillæ of these membranes cannot
be questioned: at their origin, where they
dip into the cavities, even in the commencement
of these cavities, as on the
tongue, the palate, the internal surface
of the alæ nasi, on the glans, in the fossa
naviculare, on the inside of the lips, &amp;c.,
inspection is sufficient to demonstrate
them. But, we ask, do these papillæ
exist also in those parts of mucous membranes
which are more remote from the
surface of the body? Analogy answers
in the affirmative, since sensibility is the
same there as at their origin; but inspec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>tion
proves it in a no less certain manner.
I believe, that the villosities with which
we see them everywhere thickly furnished
are nothing else than these papillæ.</p>

<p>29. Very different notions have been
entertained concerning the nature of these
villosities: they have been considered, in
the œsophagus and in the stomach, as
destined to the exhalation of the gastric
juice, in the intestines as serving for the
absorption of chyle, &amp;c. But (1) It is
difficult to conceive how an organ, so
nearly similar throughout its extent, should
fulfil, in different parts, such different
functions; I say so nearly similar, because
we know, that the villosities of the small
are more prominent than those of the
large intestines. (2) What would be the
functions of the villosities of the pituitary
membrane, of the internal coat of the
urethra, and of the bladder, if they had
no connection with the sensibility of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
membranes. (3) The microscopic experiments
so boasted of by Leiberkuhn, on
the erection of the intestinal villosities,
have been contradicted by those of Hunter
and Cruikshank, and, above all, by those
of Hewson. I can assert, that I have
never seen any thing of the kind on the
surface of the small intestines during the
absorption of chyle, and yet it appears to
be a thing that cannot vary in different
examinations. (4) It is true that these
intestinal villosities are everywhere accompanied
by a vascular web, which gives
them a colour very different from that of
the cutaneous papillæ; but the nonappearance
of the cutaneous web is occasioned
only by atmospherical pressure, by means
of the contraction that it produces in the
minute vessels: see, for instance, the
newly-born infant; its cutaneous surface
is as red as that of its mucous membranes,
and if the papillæ were a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
elongated the skin would exactly resemble
the internal surface of the intestines:
moreover, who does not know, that the
vascular web surrounding the papillæ is
rendered so apparent by fine injections as
entirely to change the colour of the
skin?</p>

<p>30. That in the stomach this vascular
web exhales the gastric juice, and in the
intestines it is interlaced with the origin of
the absorbents, so that they embrace the
villosities, are facts that we must admit,
after the experiments and observations of
the anatomists, who in these times have
been engaged with the lymphatic system:
but that does not contradict the assertion,
that the bases of these villosities are
nervous, and perform the same functions
only on the mucous membrane as the papillæ
do on the cutaneous organ. This
view of them, by explaining their existence
as observed generally over all the mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
surfaces, appears to me much more conformable
to the plan of nature than to
suppose that they perform, in their different
parts, diverse and frequently opposite
functions.</p>

<p>31. However, it is difficult to decide the
question by ocular observation; the tenuity
of these prolongations conceals their
structure even from our microscopic instruments,
a kind of agents by which
physiology and anatomy do not appear to
me in other respects ever to have obtained
great assistance, because when parts are
so viewed each person sees in his own
way, and is impressed accordingly. It is
therefore the observing of the vital functions
that should above all guide us.
Now by judging of the villosities in this
way it appears evident, that they have the
nature which I have attributed to them.
The following experiment will serve to
demonstrate the influence of the corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
papillaire upon the cutaneous sensibility:
it succeeds also with mucous membranes.
If we remove any part of the epidermis,
and irritate the corps papillaire with a
pointed instrument, the animal writhes,
cries, and gives signs of acute pain. If
afterwards the cutis be pierced, and with
the instrument the internal surface of the
chorion be irritated, the animal will not
appear to suffer pain, unless by accident
some nervous filaments should be touched.
Thence it follows very evidently, that the
sensibility of the skin resides in its external
surface, that the nerves pass through
the chorion without being interwoven with
its texture, and that their diffusion only
takes place on the corps papillaire. It is
the same in mucous surfaces.</p>

<p>32. The length and form of the villosities
vary in the different mucous surfaces.
Their appearance is not the same in the
stomach, the intestines, the bladder, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gall bladder, on the glans, &amp;c.; which
variation exactly coincides with the sensibility
peculiar to each organ, a sensibility
proved by numerous observations since
Bordeu, who was the first to direct the
attention of physiologists to the particular
modifications that this property undergoes
in the different parts.</p>

<p>33. Like the skin, the mucous membranes
have their chorion: it is thick on
the palate, gums, and pituitary membrane,
delicate in the stomach and intestines, not
very distinct in the bladder, gall bladder,
and excretory ducts. It appears to be
formed of condensed cellular strata,
strongly united, as in the skin. Maceration
develops this texture in a very sensible
manner. There is nevertheless this
difference, that in dropsy the cutaneous
chorion rises and resolves itself into distinct
cellules, that become filled with
water, whilst no such change takes place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the mucous chorion under similar circumstances.
Does this difference in the
morbid state suppose a dissimilarity of
structure? Certainly not; for the synovial
membrane is evidently of the same
nature as the serous membranes; and nevertheless
it does not participate in the
hydropic diathesis which often affects them
universally. It would be curious to expose
mucous membranes to the action of tan,
to see if they would present the same
phenomena as the skin.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">OF THE GLANDS OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>34. Besides the three strata, which
we have just mentioned, the mucous
membranes present in their structure a
great number of glands and blood vessels.
The mucous glands exist in all membranes
which bear that appellation: they are
situate under their chorion, and even in
its substance: they continually discharge,
through imperceptible orifices, a mucilaginous
fluid, which lubricates their free
surface, and defends it from the impression
of the bodies with which it is in
contact, at the same time that it facilitates
the passage of those substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>35. These glands, which are very apparent
in the bronchi, palate, œsophagus, and intestines,
where they take the name of the
anatomists who have particularly described
them, are less obvious in the bladder, the
gall bladder, uterus, vesiculæ seminales,
&amp;c.; but the mucus which moistens the
membranes unequivocally demonstrates
their existence. In fact, since this fluid
is nearly of the same nature on all the
mucous surfaces, and, in those where the
glands are apparent, is evidently furnished
by them, it must be secreted in the same
manner in those where they are less evident.
The identity of secreted fluids, certainly,
supposes the identity of the secreting
organs. It should seem, that in situations
where these glands escape our observation,
nature makes up for their tenuity by increasing
their number. In the lower
animals, particularly in the intestines,
they form by their number a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of new layer, in addition to those we
have described. The same may be observed
in the palate, velum, &amp;c. in
man.</p>

<p>36. There is therefore this great difference
between mucous and serous membranes;
that the fluid which lubricates
the former is furnished by secretion, whilst
that which moistens the latter is produced
by exhalation. We know but little of the
composition of mucous fluids, because in
the natural state it is difficult to collect
them, and in the morbid state, where their
quantity increases, as for instance in catarrhs,
their composition probably undergoes
some alteration: but their functions
in the animal economy are well ascertained.</p>

<p>37. The first of these functions is to defend
the mucous membranes from the impressions
of the bodies with which they
are in contact, and which, as we have ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>served,
are all heterogeneous to the animal.
Here, without doubt, we see the
reason why the mucous fluids are more
abundant in the cavities where these
bodies remain for some time, as in the
bladder, at the extremity of the rectum,
&amp;c., than in those organs through which
they merely pass, as in the ureters, and
in general in all the excretory ducts.
Observe again, why, when the impression
of these bodies might be hurtful,
these fluids are poured out upon their
surfaces in a much greater quantity. The
sound which is introduced into the urethra,
and is allowed to remain there;
the instrument that is left in the vagina
to secure a polypus; that which, with
a similar intention, remains some time
in the nasal fossæ; the canula, fixed
in the lacrymal sac, to remove the obstruction;
and the tube that is introduced
into the œsophagus, when deglutition is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
interrupted, always determine a more
plentiful secretion upon the corresponding
mucous surface. This is one of the principal
causes why it is so difficult to retain
elastic tubes in the trachea; the abundance
of mucous fluid, which is then separated,
chokes up the apertures of the instrument,
and renders its frequent removal
necessary, and may even threaten the patient
with suffocation, as Desault has himself
observed, although he has nevertheless
many times succeeded with that operation.</p>

<p>38. It therefore appears, that every
acute excitement of mucous surfaces determines,
in the corresponding glands, a
remarkable augmentation of action. But
how can this excitement, which does not
take place immediately upon the glands,
have so great an influence over them?
For, as we have said, these glands are
always subjacent to the membrane, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are consequently separated by it from the
irritating bodies. It appears that the
above fact belongs to a general modification
of the glandular sensibility, which
is susceptible of being put into action by
every irritation upon the extremities of
the excretory ducts, which will be proved
by the following considerations: (1) The
presence of food in the mouth produces
a more abundant flow of saliva. (2) The
catheter fixed in the bladder, and irritating
the ureters, or their vicinity, increases
the flow of urine. (3) The introduction
of a bougie, but half way up
the urethra, will often be sufficient to
occasion the bladder to contract with a
power equal to force the urine through
the passage, and so to overcome an obstruction
in the canal. (4) The irritation
of the glans, and of the extremity of the
urethra, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub coitu</span>, determines the contraction
of the vesiculæ seminales, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
augments the secretory action of the
testes. (5) The action of an irritating
fluid on the tunica conjunctiva occasions
an abundant flow of tears. (6) In making
experiments upon the state of the abdominal
viscera during digestion, and under
the influence of hunger, I have observed,
that whilst the food is only in the stomach
there is very little flow of bile; but
it increases when the aliment passes
into the duodenum, so that then there
is a considerable quantity in the intestines.
During hunger the gall bladder
is distended, and but little bile flows into
the intestines. At the end of digestion,
and even when that process is half finished,
the gall bladder contains but half of its
full quantity; yet it might be expected
to empty itself more easily during abstinence,
for then the bile it contains is of
a deep green colour, very bitter, very
acrid, and likely to irritate the organ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which encloses it. On the contrary, during,
or immediately after digestion, it
is more clear, mild, and less irritating;
there must, therefore, be, during digestion,
another stimulus: now this stimulus
is the aliment passing over the mouth of
the ductus communis choledochus<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>39. Let us conclude, from these numerous
considerations, that one of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
means that nature employs to augment
the action of the glands, and to excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that of their excretory ducts, is irritation
upon the extremities of these ducts. We
must refer to that cause the abundant
secretion and excretion of mucous fluids
in the cases above stated. It is also to
this susceptibility of the mucous glands,
to be excited by irritation at the extremities
of their excretory ducts, that we
must attribute the artificial catarrhs which
are occasioned by the respiration of chlorine
gas; the flow of mucus which attends
a polypus, any tumour in the vagina,
stone in the bladder, &amp;c. The frequent
occurrence of leuchorrhea in women
who use coition immoderately, the abun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>dant
flow of mucus from the noses of
those persons who take snuff, in all these
cases there is evidently an irritation of the
mouths of the mucous ducts.</p>

<p>40. The mucous membranes, by the
continual secretion of which they are the
seat, perform a principal part in the animal
economy. They are to be regarded
as one of the grand emunctories, by which
the residue of the nutriment constantly
escapes from the body; and consequently
as one of the principal agents of that
habitual decomposition which carries away
from living bodies the particles which
for some time formed part of the solids,
but have at length become heterogeneous
to them.</p>

<p>41. Remark the fact, that none of the
mucous fluids enter into the circulation,
but are thrown out externally; that of
the bladder, ureters, and urethra, with
the urine; that of the vesiculæ seminales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and of the vassa defferentia with the semen;
that of the nostrils by the action
of blowing the nose; that of the mouth
partly by evaporation, and partly by the
anus with the excrements; that of the
bronchi by the pulmonary exhalation, which
is effected principally by the solution of
this mucous fluid in the air of respiration;
those of the œsophagus, of the stomach,
of the intestines, of the gall bladder,
&amp;c., with the excrements of which they
frequently form, in the ordinary state, a
part nearly equal to the residue of the
aliment; and they even compose almost
the whole of the matter voided in certain
dysenteries and fevers, where the quantity
is evidently disproportionate to the food
that has been taken. Let us observe on
this subject, that in the analysis of the
fluids, in contact with the membranes of
which we speak, as the urine, bile, gastric
juice, &amp;c., there are always some errors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
because it is very difficult, impossible even,
to separate them from the mucous fluids.</p>

<p>42. If we call to mind what has been
said above, upon the extent of the two
general mucous surfaces, that they are
equal and even superior to the extent of
the cutaneous organ; if we afterwards
contemplate these two grand surfaces,
constantly throwing off the mucous
fluids, we shall see of what importance
this evacuation must be in the economy,
and of what derangements its lesion may
become the source. It is doubtless to this
law of nature, which ordains that every
mucous fluid shall be rejected externally,
that in the fœtus we must attribute the
presence of the unctuous fluid, of which
the gall bladder is full, and of the meconium
choking up the intestines, &amp;c.,
kinds of fluids which appear to be only
a collection of mucous juices, which, as
they cannot be evacuated, remain, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
birth, upon the organs where they have
been secreted.</p>

<p>43. It is not the mucous fluids only
that are rejected externally; almost all the
fluids, separated from the mass of blood
by the means of secretion, have the same
destiny: this is evident in the most considerable
part of the bile. It is very probable,
also, that the saliva, the pancreatic
juice, and the tears, are discharged with
the fæces, and that it is their want of
colour alone that prevents them from
being distinguished like the bile. I do
not know even if, in reflecting on a crowd
of phenomena, one would not be tempted to
establish, as a general principle, that no
fluid, separated by secretion, returns into
the circulation; that this destination belongs
only to fluids separated by exhalation,
as those of the serous cavities, of
the articulations, of the medullary organ,
&amp;c.; that all the fluids are thus excre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>mental
or recremental, and that there is
no recremental excrement, as the common
division points out<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>.</p>

<p>44. What is certain, at least, is, (1)
that I have never been able to effect the
absorption of bile or saliva by the lymphatics.
When I have injected them into
the cellular tissue of an animal they have
always produced inflammation and suppuration.
(2) We know that the urine, when
infiltrated, does not become absorbed, and
that it strikes with death every part that it
touches; whilst the infiltrations of lymph,
or of blood, are readily absorbed. (3)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
There is an essential difference between
the blood and the secreted fluids as concerns
their decomposition, whilst exhaled
fluids and serum, &amp;c., are in that respect
very similar.</p>

<span class="small">OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF MUCOUS
MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>45. The mucous membranes receive a
great number of vessels: the remarkable
redness which distinguishes them would
be sufficient to prove it to us, if it could
not be demonstrated by injections. This
redness is not everywhere uniform; it is
less in the bladder, large intestines, and
frontal sinuses; very marked in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the mach, small'">the
stomach, small</ins> intestines, and vagina, &amp;c.
It is produced by a web of very numerous
vessels, whose supplying branches, after
having passed through the chorion, finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
on its surface by an infinite division, embracing
the corps papillaire, and is covered
only by the epidermis.</p>

<p>46. It is the superficial position of these
vessels that frequently exposes them to
hæmorrhages, as we remark principally
in the nose, and as is seen in hæmoptysis,
hæmatemæsis, hæmaturia, in certain
dysenteries, where the blood escapes from
the parieties of the intestines, in uterine
hæmorrhages, &amp;c.; so that those spontaneous
hæmorrhages, which are independent
of any external violence applied
to the open vessels, appear to be special
affections of the mucous membranes; they
are seldom observed but in these organs,
and they form at least one of the grand
characteristics which distinguishes them
from all the other membranes.</p>

<p>47. It is also the superficial situation
of the vascular system of mucous membranes
that renders their visible portions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as on the lips, the glans, &amp;c.; serviceable
in showing us the state of the circulation.
Thus, in various kinds of asphyxia,
in submersion, strangulation, &amp;c.,
these parts present a remarkable lividity;
the effect of the difficulty that the venous
blood finds in passing through the lungs,
and of its reflux towards the surfaces
where the venous system arises from that
of the arteries.</p>

<p>48. I have already observed in the
fœtus, and newly born infant, that the
vascular system is as apparent in the cutaneous
organ as in the mucous membranes;
that the redness is there the
same; it is even in that part more marked
in the earlier periods of conception; but
soon after birth all the redness of the
skin seems to concentrate itself upon the
mucous membranes, which before, being
inactive, had no need of so considerable
a circulation, but which, becoming all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
once the principal seat of the phenomena
of digestion, of the excretion of the bile,
of the urine, of the saliva, &amp;c., demand
a larger quantity of blood. The long
continued exposure of mucous membranes
to the air frequently occasions them to
lose their characteristic redness, and they
then assume the colour of the skin (as
M. Sabattier has well observed in treating
on prolapses of the uterus and vagina).
By this circumstance some have been deceived
in believing such instances to be
cases of Hermaphrodism.</p>

<p>49. An important question in the history
of the vascular system of the mucous
membranes presents itself, which is, does
this system admit more or less blood,
according to its various circumstances?
As the organs within which this sort of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'membranes is spread'">membrane is spread</ins> are nearly all of
them susceptible of contraction and dilatation,
as is observable in the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
intestines, bladder, &amp;c., it has been believed,
that during their dilatation the
vessels, being more spread out, received
more blood, and that during their contraction,
on the contrary, being folded on
themselves, and as it were strangulated,
they admitted but a small portion of this
fluid, which then flows back into the
adjacent organs. M. Chaussier has applied
these principles to the stomach, the
circulation of which he has considered as
being alternately the inverse of that of the
omentum, which receives, during the vacuity
of that organ, the blood which it,
being in a state of contraction, cannot
admit. Since M. Lieutaud, an analogous
use has been attributed to the spleen.
Observe what I have ascertained on this
subject from the inspection of animals
opened during abstinence, and in the
various periods of digestion.</p>

<p>50. (1) Whilst the stomach is in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
state of repletion its vessels are more apparent
on its exterior surface than during
its vacuity; its mucous surface at this
time has no higher degree of redness, but
it has sometimes appeared to me to be
less red than when the viscus was empty.
(2) The omentum, being less extended
during the plenitude of the stomach, presents
nearly the same number of apparent
vessels, equal in length, but more folded
upon themselves than during the vacuity
of that organ<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>. If they are then less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
loaded with blood the difference is scarcely
perceptible. I would here observe, that
great care is requisite in opening the
animal, or the blood will fall upon the
omentum, and prevent us from ascertaining
its real state. (3) I am confident that
there is no such constant relation between
the volume of the spleen and the stomach
in its different states of vacuity or plenitude;
and if that organ increases and
diminishes under various circumstances, it
is not always in the inverse ratio of the
state of the stomach. Like Lieutaud, I
at first made experiments on dogs, in
order to satisfy myself respecting the facts
just stated; but the inequality in the size
and age of those which were brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
me leading me to fear that I might not be
able to compare their spleens correctly, I
repeated them on Guinea pigs, whose size
and condition corresponded, and examined,
at the same time, some whilst the
stomach was empty, and others whilst it
was full. I have almost always found the
volume of the spleen nearly equal, or at
least the difference has not been very perceptible.
Nevertheless, in other experiments
I have seen the spleen, under various
circumstances, to show variations
in its volume, but more particularly in
weight; and this was the same during
digestion as after that process was finished.
From what has been said it appears, that
if, whilst the stomach is empty, there is a
reflux of blood to the omentum and spleen,
it is less than has been commonly asserted.
Moreover, during this state of vacuity,
the numerous folds of the mucous membrane
of this viscus leaving it, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
before said, almost as much extent of
surface, and consequently of vessels, as
during its plenitude, the blood must circulate
there nearly as freely as when the
viscus is in a contrary state; it has therefore
no real obstacles; the only impediment
is in consequence of the tortuous
direction the vessels are then thrown into.
Now this obstacle is easily surmounted,
since the vessels suffer no constriction or
diminution of calibre by the contraction
of the stomach.</p>

<p>51. As respects the other hollow organs,
it is difficult to examine the circulation of
their adjacent viscera during their plenitude
or vacuity; for their vessels are not
superficial, as in the omentum, or insulated,
as in the spleen; therefore, to decide
this question concerning them, we
can only observe the state of the mucous
membranes upon their internal surface.
Now they have always appeared to me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
red during the contraction as during the
dilatation of the organs. Finally, I give
this only as a fact, without pretending to
draw any inference from it opposed to the
common opinion. It is, in fact, possible,
that though the quantity of blood be always
nearly the same, the rapidity of the
circulation may increase; and consequently,
in a given time, more of this fluid
will be sent there during the plenitude of
the viscera. This appears to be necessary
for the secretion of the mucous fluids,
which are then more abundant.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">OF THE VARIATIONS IN THE ORGANIZATION
OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES IN DIFFERENT
REGIONS.</span></h2>


<p>52. The assemblage of the epidermis,
corps papillaire, chorion, glands, and
vessels, constitutes in the mucous membranes
their intimate organization, which
presents very considerable variations in
the different regions in which they are
examined. I shall point out only the
principal of them; for in no different parts
do these membranes present the same appearance,
and in order to describe all their
differences they should all be examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>53. One of these variations is that
which the aspect of mucous membranes
presents at their origin, when compared
with their appearance in the more remote
parts of the organs. Compare, for instance,
the surface of the glans, the inner
surface of the lips, the orifice of the urethra,
&amp;c., with any portion of the inner
surfaces of the stomach, intestines, &amp;c.
In the first the corps papillaire will be
seen slightly marked, and offering no villous
character, the epidermis thick, very
distinct, and easily separated, the chorion
very evident, the vessels rather less superficial,
the mucous glands numerous and
very large, more especially in the mouth;
in the other characters almost opposite
will be observed; we should say, that the
mucous membranes have at their origin a
structure of a middle kind between the
skin and their deeper portions.</p>

<p>54. Another variation of structure, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
less striking, is that which is met with in
that portion of mucous surface which lines
the sinuses. Here it has more redness,
and an extreme tenuity; the three layers
cannot be distinguished; and although
there is a considerable secretion of mucous
fluids, there are no perceptible mucous
glands. Such are the characters of those
portions of the pituitary membrane, which
are considered as adapted to augment the
sensation of smell, but which do not perform
that function in the manner generally understood.
In fact, the instant when an
odour enters the nose, having the air for
its vehicle, it cannot at once pass into the
sinuses, because the orifices by which
these cavities communicate with the nose
are very small; but it enters gradually,
impregnates all the air which they contain,
and not being able to escape readily, for
the same reason that rendered its entrance
difficult, the sensation is prolonged, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the general pituitary membrane is soon
dissipated by the action of the fresh air.
Thus therefore the pituitary membrane is
destined to receive the impressions of
odours, and its extensions into the cavities
of the sinuses to retain them.</p>

<p>55. With regard to the particular structure
of that portion of mucous membrane
which lines the sinuses I remark, that it
is absolutely the same as of that which
is spread over the surface of the internal
ear, with the exception of a still more
delicate tissue. All anatomists call this
membrane the periosteum of the bony
covering of the internal ear. The following
considerations prove that it is not a
fibrous membrane, analogous to that
which covers the bones, but a mucous
layer, like that of the sinuses. (1) It is
evidently seen to be a continuation of the
pituitary membrane by the medium of the
Eustachian tube. (2) It is found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
habitually moist with a mucous fluid,
which is discharged through that tube, a
property foreign to fibrous membranes,
both of whose surfaces are always attached
to some parts of the animal structure.
(3) No fibre can be distinguished
in it. (4) Its spongy appearance, though
whitish, its softness, the readiness with
which it gives way to the least agent directed
against it, with a view to tear it,
form a character not to be found in any
part of the periosteum.</p>

<p>56. I pass over the other variations of
structure in mucous membranes in their
different regions; in all they have real
differences. I observe only, (1) That
these variations distinguish them from
serous membranes, whose aspect is everywhere
the same, as may be seen by comparing
the pericardium with the peritoneum,
&amp;c. (2) The sensibility of mucous
membranes varies in a very peculiar man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>ner
in their different portions: thus an emetic
irritates the stomach, but not the conjunctiva;
the pituitary membrane perceives
only odours; the mucous surface of the
tongue flavours, &amp;c. On the contrary,
the contact of all kinds of bodies with
the naked serous membranes produces
phenomena exactly analogous.</p>

<br />
<span class="small">OF THE VITAL POWERS OF THE MUCOUS
MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>57. The sensibility of mucous membranes
is one of the principal characteristics
that distinguishes them from other
analogous organs. This power, which
belongs to organic bodies, is variable in
every part, prompt to develop itself in
some parts, under the influence of the least
excitement, roused with difficulty in
others, present in every part, liable to
proceed by means of inflammation from
the most obscure state to the last degree
of intensity&mdash;this power is here remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>able
for features very analogous to those
which it presents in the cutaneous surface
(to which, as we have stated, the mucous
surface has great traits of resemblance)
as respects its structure. It is to
this analogy of sensibility that we must
refer a crowd of phenomena, which are
alternately exhibited in an inverse order
upon both surfaces. I shall now point
out some of these phenomena in succession.</p>

<p>58. (1) When the temperature of the surrounding
air deadens the sensibility of the
cutaneous organ, by contracting its tissue,
the sensibility of the mucous surface receives
a remarkable increase of energy.
Observe why in winter, and in cold climates,
where the functions of the skin
are singularly limited, all those of the
mucous membranes are in proportion augmented;
thence arises a more evident
pulmonary exhalation, the internal secre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>tions
are more abundant, digestion is more
active and more ready to operate, consequently
the appetite is the more easily excited.
(2) When, on the contrary, the
heat of the climate, or of the season, &amp;c.
relaxes and opens the cutaneous surface,
we should say, that the mucous surface is
in proportion constricted: during summer,
in the south, &amp;c. there is a diminution in
the internal secretions, the urine for instance;
a tardiness in the digestive phenomena
by a default in the actions of the
stomach and intestines, and the appetite
is slow in returning. (3) The sudden
suppression of the functions of the cutaneous
organ often determines a morbid
increase of action in those of the mucous
membrane. Cold air, which checks the
perspiration, frequently produces colds
and catarrhs, affections which are marked
by the sensibility and increased action of
the mucous glands. (4) In various affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>tions
of the mucous membranes, baths,
which relax and determine to the skin,
produce beneficial effects.</p>

<p>59. The foregoing considerations evidently
establish the influence, which the
vital powers of the skin have over those
of the mucous membranes. Others,
not less important, demonstrate the reciprocal
dependence in which the skin
is found with the same membranes,
as respects their vital powers. (1) During
digestion, when the mucous fluids
are poured out in abundance into the
stomach and intestines, when, consequently,
the mucous membranes of the
alimentary canal are in high action, the
fluid of insensible perspiration is evidently
diminished, according to the observation
of Santorius: it is very small in quantity
three hours after a meal, so that the action
of the cutaneous organ is visibly less
energetic. (2) During sleep, when all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the internal functions become more
marked and are in full action, at which
time the sensibility of the mucous membranes
is consequently highly excited, the
skin appears to be seized by a manifest
debility&mdash;a debility, which is evinced by
the cold which it experiences when the
animal reposes at night uncovered, and
by its want of susceptibility of various
impressions.</p>

<p>60. The sensibility of the mucous membranes,
like that of the cutaneous organ,
is essentially submissive to the immense
influence of habit, which, tending incessantly
to blunt the acuteness of the sensations
of which they are the seat, reduces
the pain and the pleasure that we
receive through them equally to indifference,
which is, as some say, the middle
state.</p>

<p>61. I say, in the first place, that habit
reduces the painful sensations, which take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
place on mucous membranes, to indifference.
The presence of the catheter,
which is passed up the urethra for the
first time, is cruel the first day, painful
the second, inconvenient the third, scarcely
felt the fourth; pessaries introduced into
the vagina, bougies into the rectum, tents
in the nasal fossæ, the canula in the
nasal canal, produce, in different degrees,
the same phenomena. It is upon this
remark that is founded the possibility
of introducing instruments into the trachea
to aid respiration, and into the œsophagus
to afford artificial deglutition.
This law of habit may even transform
a painful into a pleasant impression; of
this fact the use of snuff, tobacco, and
various kinds of food, furnish us with
remarkable examples.</p>

<p>62. In the second place I observe,
that habit produces indifference to those
sensations on the mucous membranes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
which were at first agreeable. The perfumer
placed in a fragrant atmosphere,
and the cook, whose palate is constantly affected
by delicious flavours, do not experience,
in their professions, the exquisite
pleasures that they prepare for
others. Habit may even change pleasant
sensations to painful ones, as in the preceding
paragraph we saw it changed painful
to pleasing sensations. I observe, further,
that this remarkable influence of
habit is exercised only over sensations
produced by simple contact, and not over
those produced by real lesion of the mucous
membranes: thus it does not ameliorate
the pain produced by stone in the
bladder, nor that which attends polypus
in the uterus.</p>

<p>63. It is to this power of habit over
the vital energies of the mucous membranes
that we must, in part, refer the
gradual diminution of their functions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
accompanies advancing age. All is susceptibility
in the infant: in old age all
is dull. In the one the very active sensibility
of the alimentary, biliary, urinary,
and salivary mucous surfaces, is that
which principally produces that rapidity
with which the digestive and secretory phenomena
succeed each other. In the other
this sensibility, weakened by the habit
of contact, does not so closely connect
the same phenomena.</p>

<p>64. Does not the following remarkable
modification of the sensibility of the mucous
surfaces depend upon the same
cause, <em>viz.</em> that at their origin, as on the
pituitary membrane, the glans, the anus,
&amp;c., they give us the sensations of bodies
with which they are in contact, and that
they do not produce this sensation in the
deeply seated organs which they line, as
the intestines, &amp;c.? In the interior of
these organs this contact is always uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>form;
the bladder is in contact with the
urine only, the gall bladder with the bile,
the stomach with the aliments masticated
and reduced to an homogeneous, pulpy
paste, whatever may be their diversity.
This uniformity of sensation prevents perception,
because, in order to perceive,
we must compare, and here two terms
of comparison are wanting. Thus the
fœtus has no sensation of the liquor amnii:
the air is also very irritating at first
to the new-born infant, but at length it
is not felt. On the contrary, at the origins
of mucous membranes exciting agents
vary every instant: the mind can, therefore,
perceive their presence, because it
is able to establish relations between their
various modes of action. What I say is
so true, that if in the interior of the
organs the mucous membranes be in contact
with a foreign body differing from
that which is habitual to them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
transmit the sensation of it to the mind;
instruments introduced into bladder or
stomach are examples of it. Fresh air,
which in very hot weather is suddenly
introduced into the trachea, causes an
agreeable sensation over the surface of
the bronchi; but from habit we soon
become insensible to it, and the perception
ceases.</p>

<p>65. It is very difficult to point out
with precision the character of the tonic
powers of mucous membranes, because,
being almost in every part united to a
muscular layer, we can hardly distinguish
what belongs to the tonicity of the one
from what depends upon the irritability of
the other; or otherwise, if the mucous
membranes be isolated, as in the nostrils,
yet their attachment renders the phenomena
of their tonic powers very obscure.
Nevertheless, the action of the excretory
ducts on their respective fluids, that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the gall bladder, and of the vesiculæ seminales,
which are destitute of muscular
attachments, and the spasmodic contraction
of the urethra, which sometimes takes
place when the sound is introduced, leave
no doubt of the energy of this tonic
power, doubtless similar in its various
modifications to that which is observed in
the cutaneous organ.</p>

<span class="small"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'OF THE SYMPATHY'">OF THE SYMPATHIES</ins> OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>66. I distribute the sympathies of
mucous membranes, like those of most
of the other organs, into three general
classes. In the first class are ranked the
sympathies in which irritation, on one part
of the mucous surface, produces a sensation
in a distant part. A stone in the
bladder occasions pain at the end of
glans; worms in the intestines excite an
itching at the nose. Whytt has seen a
painful affection induced over the whole
side of the head by a foreign body in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
ear; an ulcer in the bladder produces a
pain in the superior parts of the thighs
every time that the patient passes his
urine.</p>

<p>67. I refer to the second class those
sympathies in which the irritation of one
point on mucous surfaces produces irritability
in a different structure; thus, too
lively an impression on the pituitary membrane
occasions sneezing; the irritation
of the bronchi coughing; biliary concretions
produce spasmodic vomiting; stones
in the bladder occasion retraction of the
testicle towards the ring. In all these
cases there is contraction of the muscles
produced by the irritation of the mucous
surface, distant from the place in which
that contraction occurs.</p>

<p>68. The last class of the sympathies
of mucous membranes embraces those in
which the irritation of any part of their
extension determines elsewhere the exer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>cise
of their tonicity. Here we must refer
to what we have said upon glandular
action being augmented by the irritation
of the extremities of the excretory ducts.
Thus it is evident, that the increase of
the tonic power of the parotid for the
secretion of the saliva, and of its excretory
duct in order to transmit it, when the
extremity of this duct is irritated by food,
sialogogue medicines, &amp;c.,&mdash;it is evident,
I say, that this augmentation is a phenomenon
purely sympathetic. We may designate
each of these three classes by the
name of the vital power which they bring
into action, calling the first sympathy of
sensibility; the second, sympathy of irritability;
and the third, sympathy of tonicity.</p>

<p>69. This manner of classing the sympathies
is entirely borrowed from the state
of the vital powers, of which they are but
irregular modifications, and only aberra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>tions,
still unknown in their nature. Nevertheless
it is subject to very great inconveniences:
yet it appears to me to
be preferable to that of Whytt, who simply
follows the order of the regions; and
even to that of Barthy, who, more methodical,
examines them successively in
the organs connected by systems, in
those which are insulated, and in those
situated in symmetrical halves of the
body.</p>

<span class="small">OF THE FUNCTIONS OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>70. I have already examined many of
the functions of mucous membranes. I
have considered them (1) As one of the
grand emunctories of the animal economy.
(2) As performing the same functions with
respect to heterogeneous bodies, which
may be within our organs, as the skin
does with regard to the bodies with which
it may be in contact. (3) As facilitating
the passage of foreign bodies by means of
the mucous fluid by which they are lubricated.
It remains for me to examine three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
questions much agitated at this time.
(1) If the mucous membranes have any
influence over the redness of the blood.
(2) If they exhale. (3) If the absorbents
arise from them; and if absorption consequently
takes place there.</p>

<p>71. The remarkable redness of these
membranes, the analogy of respiration,
during which the blood becomes changed
in colour through the mucous surface of
the bronchi, the well-known experiment
of a bladder filled with blood and placed
in oxygen gas, by which this fluid becomes
also changed in colour,&mdash;have led to the
belief, that the blood, being separated
from the atmospheric air merely by a very
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'fine pelicle'">fine pellicle</ins> on certain mucous surfaces, as
the pituitary membrane, the palatine, the
glans, &amp;c., would there also take a
brighter red colour, either by parting with
a portion of carbonic acid gas, or by combining
with the oxygen of the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and that these membranes thus fulfilled
functions accessory to those of the lungs.
The experiments of Jurine upon the cutaneous
organ, experiments adopted by
many celebrated physicians, appear also to
favour the reality of that conjecture.</p>

<p>72. Observe the experiment that I have
tried, in order to ascertain the validity of
that fact. Through a wound in the abdomen
I drew out a portion of intestine,
which I tied at one point. I then returned
it, keeping back a part, which I punctured,
and introduced into it sufficient
atmospheric air to distend all that portion
of the bowel between the ligature and the
orifice. I then confined the air by another
ligature, and reduced the whole. At the
end of an hour the animal was opened.
I compared the blood of the mesenteric
veins, which arise from that portion of
intestine distended by air, with the blood
of the other mesenteric veins arising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the remainder of the canal: no difference
of colour could be observed: the internal
surface of the inflated intestine did not
exhibit a brighter red. I expected to
obtain a more marked effect by repeating
the same experiment on another animal
with oxygen gas, but I did not perceive
any variation in the colour of the blood.
As on the mucous membranes, which are
ordinarily in contact with the air, this
fluid is constantly renewed, and is agitated
by a perpetual movement, I tried to produce
the same effect in the intestines; for
which purpose I made two openings into
the abdomen, through each of which I
drew a portion of the intestinal tube. I
opened these two portions, adapting to
one the tube of a bladder filled with oxygen
gas, and to the other that of an empty
bladder. I then pressed the full bladder
so as to make the oxygen gas pass into
the empty one through the intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
portion of intestine which was in the abdomen,
so that the warmth there might
encourage the circulation. The oxygen
gas was in this manner sent many times
from one bladder to the other, making a
current through the intestine, which from
its contraction was more difficult than it
at first appeared to be. The abdomen
was then opened, but no difference was
found between the venous blood returning
from that portion of the intestine, and
that which flowed from the other parts of
the canal. The superficial situation of
the mesenteric veins, which are covered
by only a fine transparent lamina of peritoneum,
and their volume when the animal
is not fat, render these comparisons
very easy to be made.</p>

<p>73. I think, that from what occurs in
the intestines we cannot infer what takes
place in the pituitary and palatine membranes,
&amp;c.; because, although analogous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their organization may be different. In
these parts we cannot examine the venous
blood returning from them, as in the intestines:
but, (1) If we consider, that
in animals, which have for some time
respired oxygen gas, the mucous membrane
of the fauces does not exhibit any
increase of redness; (2) If we bear in
mind, that the lividity of different parts of
this membrane, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in those asphyxies'">in those asphyxias</ins> which
are produced by carbonic acid gas, is not
occasioned by the immediate contact of
this gas with the membranes, but by the reflux
towards the surface, of the venous blood
which cannot pass through the heart, as
occurs in submersion, as demonstrated by
Godwin, and as takes place in all those
cases in which the blood, previous to
death, has found difficulty in passing
through the lungs; (3) If we remark
lastly, that in these circumstances the
contact of the air, after death, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
alter the lividity that the venous blood
gives to the mucous membranes, although
the skin is then more permeable to every
kind of æriform fluid;&mdash;we shall see that
we must at least suspend our judgment,
respecting the colouring of the blood
through mucous membranes, until farther
observations shall have decided the question.</p>

<p>74. Observe another experiment, which
may throw more light still upon the subject.
I have distended the peritoneal
cavity of different Guinea pigs with carbonic
acid gas, with hydrogen gas, with
oxygen gas, and with atmospheric air, to
see if I could obtain, through a serous
membrane, what I had not been able to
effect through a mucous surface. In
these experiments I have found no difference
in the colour of the blood of the
abdominal system: it was the same as in
fresh animals of the same kind, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
always used to compare with those on
which the experiments were made.</p>

<p>75. I believe, nevertheless, that I have
observed many times, both in frogs and in
animals with warm and red blood, such
as cats and Guinea pigs, that the infiltration
of oxygen gas into the cellular tissue
gives, after a certain time, a brighter
colour to the blood than this fluid presents
in the artificial emphysemas which may be
produced by carbonic acid gas, hydrogen
gas, or by atmospheric air, in which circumstances
the blood differs very little in
colour from its natural shade. But in
other cases oxygen gas has had no influence
over the colour of the blood; so
that, notwithstanding the many experiments
that have been made on this point,
I cannot state any general result. It
appears, that the tonic powers of the cellular
tissue, and of the coats of the
vessels which ramify in it, receive a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
varied influence from the contact of the
gases, and that, according to the nature
of that influence, the fibres contracting
and becoming more or less firm render
these parts more or less permeable, both
to the æriform fluids, which have a tendency
to escape from the blood to unite
with that of the emphysema, and to this
last fluid, if it tends to combine with the
blood. This will doubtless explain the
variations that I have observed.</p>

<p>76. Do the mucous surfaces exhale?
The analogy of the skin would seem to
lead to the belief of it; for it appears well
proved, that the perspiration is not a
transudation by the inorganic pores of the
cutaneous surface, but a true transmission
by vessels of a particular nature, and continuous
with the arterial system.</p>

<p>77. It appears, at first, that the pulmonary
perspiration which takes place on
the surface of the bronchi, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
such connection with that of the skin,
which increases or diminishes according
to the decrease or augmentation of the
other, and of which the composition is
apparently of the same nature&mdash;it appears,
I say, that the pulmonary perspiration
is produced, at least in part, by
the system of exhalent vessels; and that
if the combination of the oxygen of the
air concurs with the hydrogen of the
blood to produce it, during the act of respiration,
it is but in a very small quantity,
and for that portion only which is
purely aqueous. It is necessary to observe
further on this subject, that the dissolution
of the mucous fluid, which lubricates
the bronchi, in the air that is constantly
inspired and expired, furnishes a considerable
portion of that vapour which rises
from the lungs, and which is insensible in
summer, but very apparent in winter.</p>

<p>78. The intestinal juice, that Haller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
has particularly considered, but which
appears to be less in quantity than he had
estimated, the gastric juice, and that of
the œsophagus, are very probably disposed
of by way of exhalation on their respective
mucous surfaces; but in general it is
very difficult to distinguish with precision,
in these organs, what belongs to the
exhalent system from what is furnished
by the system of mucous glands, which, as
we have said, are everywhere subjacent to
them. Thus we constantly see the mucous
fluids of the œsophagus, stomach, and
intestines, mix themselves with the other
fluids of these parts.</p>

<p>79. That mucous membranes absorb is
evidently proved by the absorption of the
chyle upon the intestinal surfaces, of venereal
virus upon the glans and urethra,
of variolous poison which is sometimes
rubbed upon the gums, of the serous
portions of the bile, of the urine, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the semen, when they remain in their
respective reservoirs. When, from paralysis
of the fleshy fibres which terminate
the rectum, the fæces accumulate at the
extremity of that intestine (a very common
case in aged persons, and of which
Desault has cited many instances), these
accumulations frequently become hard,
probably from the absorption of their
juices, which are obstructed there. We
have many cases in which the urine has
been almost entirely absorbed by the mucous
surface of the bladder, when there
has been absolute obstruction in the urethra.
Whatever may be the mode of this
absorption, it appears that it is not performed
in a constant, uninterrupted manner,
like that of the serous membranes,
in which the exhalent and absorbent systems
are in a continual alternate action;
but that it occurs only under certain circumstances,
of which perhaps the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
part are not in the natural order of the
functions. Finally, we have yet fewer
data respecting the mode of mucous absorption
than on that of cutaneous absorption:
we confess it is very little understood,
and many even question its existence.</p>

<span class="small">REMARKS ON THE AFFECTIONS OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES.</span></h2>


<p>80. It is not my design to examine the
affections of mucous membranes; I shall
notice only some phenomena, which in
these affections I believe deserve a particular
attention, and the explanation of
which I propose to physiological physicians.</p>

<p>81. Why do mucous membranes seldom
contract adhesions from inflammation,
since that occurs so frequently in serous
surfaces under the same circumstances?
Why does not the internal surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
inflamed stomach, intestines, or bladder,
adhere in its various portions like the
pleura, tunica vaginalis, testis, &amp;c.</p>

<p>82. Why, in inflammations of mucous
membranes, is there an abundant flow of
that fluid which habitually moistens them,
and which constitutes the different kinds
of catarrhs, whilst the source of the fluid
that exhales from serous membranes is
generally dried up in analogous cases?</p>

<p>83. Why do polypi, a kind of affection
peculiar to mucous membranes, seldom
arise but at the origins of these membranes
in the vicinity of the skin, as in
the nose, pharynx, vagina, &amp;c., and not
in their more internal portions, as in the
stomach, intestines, &amp;c.? Does this arise
from the peculiarity of the texture that I
have shown mucous membranes to have in
the vicinity of those places where they
arise from the skin, or must we attribute
this fact to the more numerous causes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
irritation which act upon the origins of
these cavities?</p>

<p>84. Are not aphthæ an isolated inflammatory
affection of the glands of the mucous
membranes, whilst catarrhs are characterized
by a general inflammation of all
the parts of these membranes?</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The following questions have been much disputed:
Is there a cystic and an hepatic bile? Is the one of
a different nature from the other? Does their quantity
increase or vary? &amp;c. Contrary, and even opposite,
opinions have been supported by numerous experiments
made upon living animals, as Haller as well observed.
These experiments, though at first sight contradictory,
in reality are not so, as I have had the opportunity of
convincing myself, by repeating them in the different
stages of digestion, and during the abstinence of the
animal, which previously had never been done with
precision. The following are what I have observed in
dogs that I have used in my experiments. (1) During
abstinence, the stomach and the small intestines being
empty, yellowish clear bile was found in the hepatic
duct and ductus communis choledochus; the surface
of the duodenum and jejunum were stained by a bile
which had the same appearance; the gall bladder was
very much distended by a greenish bitter bile, which
was deeper in colour and more in quantity, according
to the length of the abstinence. (2) During the gastric
digestion, which may be prolonged for a sufficient length
of time by giving the dog large pieces of meat, which
he swallows without chewing, appearances were
similar. (3) At the commencement of intestinal
digestion, the bile in the hepatic duct was always found
yellowish; that of the ductus communis choledochus
deeper in colour; the gall bladder not so full, and its
bile becoming already more clear. (4) Towards the
end of digestion, and immediately after it, the bile of
the hepatic duct, of the ductus communis choledochus,
that contained in the gall bladder, and that which was
spread over the duodenum, were exactly of the same
colour as the common hepatic bile, a clear yellow, having
but little bitterness. The gall bladder was but half full;
it was not contracted, but flaccid.
</p>
<p>
These observations, repeated a great number of times,
evidently prove, that such is the manner in which the
bile flows during abstinence and during digestion. (1) It
appears that the liver is continually separating from itself
a sensible quantity of bile, which increases during digestion.
(2) That which is secreted during abstinence
is divided between the intestine, which is always found
coloured with it, and the gall bladder, which retains
it without transmitting any portion of it through the
cystic duct, and where, thus retained, it acquires a
deeper colour and a character of acrimony, necessary,
without doubt, to the digestion which is soon to
follow. (3) When the food, having been digested by
the stomach, passes into the duodenum, then all the
hepatic bile, which was before divided, flows into the
intestine, and even in greater abundance; the gall bladder
also pours that which it contains upon the alimentary
pulp, and with which it is then found quite incorporated.
(4) After the intestinal digestion the hepatic bile diminishes,
and begins to flow, part into the duodenum and
part into the gall bladder, where, being then examined,
it is clear and in small quantity, because it has not yet
had time either to become coloured, or to collect.
</p>
<p>
There is, therefore, this difference between the two
kinds of bile, that the hepatic flows in a continual manner
into the intestine, and the cystic, during the absence of
digestion, flows back into the gall bladder; and whilst
that function is going on it passes towards the duodenum;
or rather it is always the same fluid, of which one part
preserves the character it has when it leaves the liver,
and the other part undergoes a change in the gall bladder.
The difference of colour in the cystic bile, according
to the time that it has remained in the gall bladder,
is analogous to the colour of the urine, which becomes
deeper as it is retained longer in its receptacle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The bile in the gall bladder, the urine in the bladder,
and the semen in the vesicula seminales, are certainly
absorbed; but it is not the fluid itself that re-enters
the circulation, but only its finest parts, some of its principles
that we are not well acquainted with, probably its
aqueous or lymphatic portion. This does not resemble the
absorption in the pleura and other analogous membranes,
in which the fluid rejoins the blood in the same state as
it left it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> This is a necessary consequence of the disposition of
the vascular system of the stomach. The arteria coronaria
ventriculi superior being situated transversely between the
stomach and the omentum, and furnishing branches to
both, it is evident, that when the stomach, by separating
the duplicatures of the omentum, lodges itself between
them, and this in applying itself over the stomach becomes
shortened, the branches that it receives from that
artery cannot in the same manner apply themselves to it.
To effect this it would be necessary, that they should
proceed from the one to the other without the intermediate
trunk that cuts them at right angles; then the
stomach, by distending itself, would separate them in the
same way that it does the omentum, and would lodge
between them, instead of pushing them before it with
their common trunk, and folding them upon themselves.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
